[Wednesday 8:00 p.m.]

Finally...back from work. Your wife isn’t home yet...again.

She’ll probably say, “she’s working late”.

Checking your phone, you notice a voicemail from her.

> Hey honey, things are a bit crazy at work today, so I’ll be home late. Love you!

No surprise there. You’re going to get to the bottom of this.

...

She gets back after you fall asleep.

[Thursday morning]

You wake up early to install an app on her phone that records her phone calls and sends them to your voicemail.
You’ve done your research, clearly.

...

At work, you notice a new voicemail.

> Wife: Let’s do lunch at noon tomorrow.
>
> ???: You’re the best. Sounds great.

It seems to have cut off some of the audio, but there’s nothing suspicious yet.

You get home that night, but don’t mention anything to your wife.

...

[Friday 10:00 a.m.]

> ???: Hey, something came up and I can’t do lunch. Can you do after work?
>
> Wife: Sure, that should be fine!

The weekend passes as normal. Nothing else seems suspicious.

On Monday, you receive a voicemail around 3:00 p.m.

> ???: Meet me at the river hotel at 6:00. You know the room.
>
> Wife: I'll see you then.
>
> ???: See you then.

Another voicemail enters your inbox.

> Hey honey, my boss needs me to stay after work again. Looove you!

Shit. You were right.

Maybe you should start taking notes.

...

> Wife: Hey... Do you ever worry about getting caught?
>
> ???: As long as we play it safe we'll be fine.
> We just have to clean up and make sure there are no *fuzz/cuts/distortion*.
> It's not like it's something people haven't gotten away with before.

Ouch. Maybe it’ll be better to go to bed before she gets home.

## Husband finds out about the murdering

> *??? talking, covered by distortion*
>
> Wife: Yeah...I’m excited to try out our new toys.

Jeez, you didn’t want to hear that.

[Friday 11:30 p.m.]

Time for lunch...it looks like you have a voicemail from your friend, Dustin.

> Dustin (worried): Hey, I...I...overheard your wife at the office making...uh...*plans* with some guy...call me, okay?

Pfft, a little late if you ask me...Dusty’s always up in everyone’s business anyways. *Embarrassing.* You need to talk to your wife tonight.

[Friday 5:05 p.m.]

> Wife: This is bad. Dusty was giving me these strange looks at work today. I think he’s on to us.
>
> ???: We can't let him tell anyone.

...

[7:00 p.m.]

She's not home yet. She didn't even bother to call.

[8:00 p.m.]

> Wife: I took care of Dusty.
>
> ???: Perfect. Get out of there. Things have started to get a little messy...I'm sorry to have to say this, but...if you go down, your husband goes with you. I hope you understand.
>
> Wife: I understand.

Yikes. Another one bites the dust.

This is too much for you. You go to bed.

[Next day]

## Wife suspects her husband knows about the murders

> Wife: I think my husband suspects something...
>
> ???: You know, we can’t have any loose ends.
>
> Wife: *sigh*...I know...He's so sweet though.
>
> ???: No. Loose. Ends.
>
> *click*
