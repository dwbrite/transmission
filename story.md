Finally...back from work. Your wife isn’t home yet...again.
She’ll probably say, “she’s working late”.
Checking your phone, you notice a voicemail from her.

> Hey honey, things are a bit crazy at work today, so I’ll be home late. Love you!

No surprise there. You’re going to get to the bottom of this.

...

She gets back after you fall asleep.

[new day]

You wake up early to install an app on her phone that records her phone calls and sends them to your voicemail. 
You’ve done your research, clearly.

...

At work, you notice a new voicemail.

> Wife: Let’s do lunch at noon tomorrow.

> ???: You’re the best. Sounds great.

It seems to have cut off some of the audio, but there’s nothing suspicious yet.


You get home that night, but don’t mention anything to your wife.

It’s 10:00 Friday, the next day.

> ???: Hey, something came up and I can’t do lunch. Can you do after work?
>
> Wife: Er...I don’t want my husband to catch on.
>
> ???: Oh please, he won’t know.

The weekend passes as normal. Nothing else seems suspicious.

On Monday, you receive a voicemail around 3:00 p.m.

> ???: Meet me at the hotel at 6:00. You know the room.
> ["the hotel" needs a name]
> 
> Wife: I'll see you then.
>
> ???: See you then.

Another voicemail enters your inbox.

> Hey honey, my boss needs me to stay after work again. Looove you!

Shit. You were right.

Maybe you should start taking notes.
 
...

> Wife: Hey... Do you ever worry about getting caught?
> 
> ???: As long as we play it safe we'll be fine. 
> We just have to clean up and make sure there are no *fuzz/cuts/distortion*.
> It's not like it's something people haven't gotten away with before.

Ouch. Maybe it'll be better to go to bed before she gets home.

## Husband finds out about the murdering

> *??? talking, covered by distortion*
>
> Wife: Yeah...I’m excited to try out our new toys.
> 
> someon: *something incriminating as heck. dis is totes murder*

...

> ???: And remember, if you go down, your husband goes down too.

[Are we still doing this? I don't understand the motivations.]

## Wife suspects her husband knows about the murders

> Wife: I think my husband suspects something...
>
> ???: You know, we can’t have any loose ends.
>
> Wife: *sigh*...I know...He's so sweet though.
>
> ???: No. Loose. Ends.
>
> *click*
