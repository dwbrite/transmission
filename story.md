Finally...back from work. Your wife isn’t home yet...again. She’ll probably says, “she’s working late”. Checking your phone, you notice a voicemail from her.

> Hey honey, things are a bit crazy at work today, so I’ll be home late. Love you!

No surprise there. You’re gonna get to the bottom of this.

...

She gets back after you fall asleep. You wake up early to install an app on her phone that records her phone calls and sends them to your voicemail. You’ve done your research, clearly.

...

At work, you notice a new voicemail.

> Wife: Let’s do lunch at noon tomorrow.
> Guy: You’re the best. Sounds great.

It seems to have cut off some of the audio, but there’s nothing suspicious yet.

You get home that night, but don’t mention anything to your wife.

It’s 10:00 Friday, the next day.

> Guy: Hey, something came up and I can’t do lunch. Can you do after work?
>
> Wife: Er...I don’t want my husband to catch on.
>
> Guy: Oh please, he won’t know.

The weekend passes as normal. Nothing else seems suspicious.

On Monday, you receive a voicemail around 3:00 p.m.

> Guy: Meet me at the hotel 6:00.

> Wife: Sure, I can do it. I just hope my husband doesn’t start to catch on.

> Guy: Yeah, I need to make sure my wife doesn’t find out either.

You were right.

Another voicemail enters your inbox.

> Hey honey, my boss needs me to stay after work again. Looove you!

Wife: Meet me at the hotel.

## Husband finds out about the murdering

Guy: Tonight’s the night.
Wife: Yeah...I’m excited to try out our new toys.

Guy: You’re husbands a liability.


Guy: And remember, if you go down, you’re husband goes down too.

## Wife suspects her husband knows about the murders

Wife: I think my husband suspects something...
Guy: You know, we can’t have any loose ends.
Wife: *sigh*...if we have to.
