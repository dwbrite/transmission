[Wednesday 6:30 p.m.]

Finally...back from work. Your wife isn’t home yet...again.

She’ll probably say, “she’s working late”.

~~Checking your phone, you notice a voicemail from her.~~

[BOOP!~ VOICEMAIL!]

> Joyce: Hey honey, things are a bit crazy at work today, so I’ll be home late. Love you!

No surprise there. You might want to get to the bottom of this.

[Thursday 5:30 a.m.]

You wake up early to install a wiretapping app. It will record and send all her calls directly to your voicemail.
You’ve done your research, clearly.

...

At work, you notice a new voicemail.

> Joyce: Let’s do lunch at noon tomorrow.
>
> ???: You’re the best. Sounds great.

It seems to have cut off some of the audio. Must be a software issue.

You get home that night, but don’t mention anything to your wife.

...

[Friday 10:00 a.m.]

> ???: Hey, something came up and I can’t do lunch. Can you do Monday after work?
>
> Joyce: Sure, that should be fine!

So that's what she's up to. Who could that be?

...

[Monday 3:00 p.m.]

Nothing interesting happened over the weekend. You've finally got another voicemail.

> ???: Meet me at the river hotel at 6:00. You know the room.
>
> Joyce: I'll see you then.
>
> ???: See you then.

Another voicemail enters your inbox.

> Joyce: Hey honey, my boss needs me to stay after work again. Looove you!

Shit.

Maybe you should start keeping track of this.

[BOOP!~ NOTES!]

[8:30 p.m.]

> Joyce: Hey... Do you ever worry about getting caught?
>
> ???: As long as we play it safe we'll be fine.
> We just have to clean up and make sure there are no *(stains or anything3)fuzz/cuts/distortion*.
> It's not like it's something people haven't gotten away with before.

Ouch. Maybe it’ll be better to go to bed before she gets home.

~~Put an input prompt here, perhaps. Tuesday morning.~~

[Wednesday]

> *()??? talking, covered by distortion*
>
> Joyce: Yeah...I’m excited to try out our new toys.

... That is *not* something you wanted to hear.


[Friday 11:30 a.m.]

Time for lunch...it looks like you have a voicemail from your friend, Dustin.

> Dustin (worried): Hey, I...I...overheard your wife at the office making...uh...*plans* with some guy...call me, okay?

Pfft, a little late if you ask me...Dusty’s always up in everyone’s business anyways.
You need to talk to your wife tonight.

[Friday 5:05 p.m.]

> Joyce: This is bad. Dusty was giving me these strange looks at work today. I think he’s on to us.
>
> ???: We can't let him tell anyone.

...

[7:00 p.m.]

She's not home yet. She didn't even bother to call.

[7:30 p.m.]

> Joyce: I took care of Dusty.
>
> ???: Perfect. Get out of there. Things have started to get a little messy...
I'm sorry to have to say this, but...if you go down, your husband goes with you.
I hope you understand.
>
> Joyce: I understand.

...

[cut it here, we can't let the audience know it's unfinished.]

[Saturday]

You spent the day at home with her until she went out “shopping”. You couldn’t help but feel weird.

<more content/voicemail>

[Later that night]

You've got another voicemail. It’s from Dusty’s boyfriend.

> Hodges: Hey, have you heard from Dusty? He was supposed to be home last night, but I haven't seen him...
> He hasn't been answering my calls.
> It's probably nothing, but... call me if you hear anything, okay? Thanks...

Things aren’t looking good. You’ve got to get some solid evidence before you report them to the police.

Act casual. Keep listening. Eventually they’ll slip.

[Monday]

> Joyce: People at work are wondering where Dustin went...
>
> ???: Lay low. We'll just have to wait until this whole thing blows over.
>
> Joyce: Thanks, Ch—{static}

Ch! That’s something to work with...

The next week is quiet.

You’re not sure how much longer you can live with a serial killer.

[Next Week, Sunday]

> ???: I have a job for you.
>
> Joyce: What’s up?
>
> ???: The Bensons...
>
> Joyce: All of them?
>
> ???: Mmm.
>
> Joyce: When?
>
> ???: This Friday. You’ll need to get there by 4:30 to get there before Carmen gets home from work.
>
> Joyce: Can do.

Yikes, you better find out some information *and fast*. You can’t let her follow through with this.

[Thursday]

You notice a voicemail from an hour ago.

> Joyce: I’m at the Bensons’.
>
> ???: Excellent.

God, she’s already there. You must’ve missed their change in plans. You have to do something.

You call your wife to try to stop her, but you hang up before she has time to answer.

Your phone rings. You let it go to voicemail.

> Joyce: Hey honey, what’s up? I’m at work.

At work is right.

Another voicemail.

> Joyce: It’s done.
>
> ???: Perfect.

...

You must’ve caught her in the act.

You...let her kill them.

---

> Joyce: I think my husband suspects something...
>
> ???: You know, we can’t have any loose ends.
>
> Joyce: *sigh*...I know...He's so sweet though.
>
> ???: No. Loose. Ends.
>
> *click*

You have to report it before things get any worse.
